## Projects
The following is a not exhaustive list of projects where I have been involved. It includes international and national fund projects, as well as personal (not fund) software projects.

#### Trusted Extremely Precise Mapping and Prediction for Emergency Management (TEMA)

TEMA is a four year long project funded by the European Union flagship research and Innovation programme Horizon Europe, under the call HORIZON-CL4-2022-DATA-01-01 “Methods for exploiting data and knowledge for extremely precise outcomes (analysis, prediction, decision support), reducing complexity and presenting insights in understandable way”.

The objectives of TEMA are specifically to:

1. Improve Natural Disaster Management using new digital technologies and extreme data analytics;
1. Improve and accelerate extreme data analytics, by increasing trustworthiness, accuracy and responsiveness of extreme data analysis algorithms;
1. Improve and accelerate emergency phenomenon modeling, evolution predictions, simulation and interactive visualization;

The goal of TEMA is to deliver a technical solution that is supportive in disaster response and management by bringing situational data to relevant end-users, enabling transferability to tackle different disaster types in various geographic region thus providing the relevant information that can help make the best possible operative decisions. TEMA will provide a tool that:

- is an AI-enabled Natural Disaster Management platform that will allow precise replication and modeling of real events;
- offers precise semantic 3D area mapping and NDM event prediction over a long time period;
- has interactive, intuitive and accessible visualization enabled by advanced augmented reality.

It will allow human operators to understand complex Natural Disaster Management phenomena and easily evaluate alternative response strategies by a smart selection of platform parameters and by novel ways of combining heterogeneous (visual and non-visual) data and/or augmented reality.<br>

The *upy-series* (read it as micropy series) is a collection of libraries and drivers built for MicroPython-based boards (i.e., ESP32, RP2040, etc.). It includes, i.e., drivers for YL-69 or HL-69 resistive soil moisture sensor, relays, etc.<br>
