#### Research Agenda
As enhanced devices at the edge of the network exploit artificial intelligence, even novel computing challenges are raised. In my current research agenda, I investigate all aspects related to distributed intelligent systems for supporting cities and communities, with a strong focus on optimizing decentralized and self-organized infrastructures. My research finds application in several domains, among which smart city, mobility, healthcare, and cultural heritage.

#### Short Biography
I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://fcrlab.unime.it/">Future Computing Research Laboratory</a> at the Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Hearth Sciences of the <a href="https://international.unime.it/">University of Messina</a>. I was research fellow in the same university and I earned my Ph.D. in the Department of Engineering at <a href="https://www.unirc.it/en/">University of Reggio Calabria</a> in May 2020 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12645423500">Massimo Villari</a>.

I led activities related to the technical area for the EU project "FLIWARE" and the Italian FISR "Re-functionalization of the Contemporary". From 2018 to 2020, I worked as software developer of <a href="https://humanizing.com/en/">Humanizing Technologies GmbH</a> in Vienna, one of the most appreciated suppliers of non-industrial robots and robot software worldwide. From 2020, I am an <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/44cecf40-460e-4730-aa49-79733224134e/public_url">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a>. From 2021, I am authorized to practice as Information Engineer (Italy, Section A).

I have been teacher of several subjects, among which Computer Networks and Algorithms, and teacher's guide of Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence. I am reviewer of respected Springer, IEEE and Elsevier Journals, coordinator of the University of Messina's node for the <a href="https://www.consorzio-cini.it/index.php/it/lab-infolife">CINI InfoLife</a> Laboratory, Associate Editor for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/sections/smart-sensor-networks-and-autonomy">Frontiers in Robotics and AI</a>, member of the <a href="http://www.ifiptc12.org/component/tags/tag/41-wg-12-9">IFIP Working Group 12.9 about Computational Intelligence</a>, co-chairs of IEEE Workshops (<a href="https://fcrlab.unime.it/calls/distinsys2022">DistInSys</a>, <a href="https://fcrlab.unime.it/calls/mriche2021">MrICHE</a>, and <a href="https://www.ai4health.icar.cnr.it/">AI4Health</a>) and co-author of more than 40 manuscripts.
